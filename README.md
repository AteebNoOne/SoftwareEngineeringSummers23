## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

In this section, you can explore various Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models that have been studied during the course.

### Agile Model

Contributor: Mahnoor Fatima

The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on collaboration, adaptability, and customer satisfaction. It emphasizes the importance of frequent feedback and the ability to respond to changing requirements throughout the development process.

### Spiral Model

Contributor: Abdul Raffay

The Spiral model is a risk-driven SDLC model that combines iterative development with elements of the Waterfall model. It is particularly useful for projects where risk assessment and management are critical. The Spiral model involves multiple cycles of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.

### Waterfall Model

Contributor: Maham Majid

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It divides the development process into distinct phases, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
